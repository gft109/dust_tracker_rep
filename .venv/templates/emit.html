        <p>Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) was developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on July 14, 2022. The instrument will observe Earth from outside the International Space Station, collecting data on dust suspended in the air and its effect on heating or cooling the atmosphere and Earth's surface. Once it begins operation, EMIT data will be available for use by other researchers and the public.</p>

        <p>Finally, the goal of EMIT is to advance understanding of the Earth’s mineral dust cycle and its impact on radiative forcing. Its objectives can be separated in two:
            Constrain the sign and magnitude of the dust direct radiative forcing at regional and global scales;
            Predict the increase or decrease of available dust sources under future climate scenarios. </p>

        <p>Using the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) data, delivered by EMIT, our team goal is to identify the existence, analyze the composition and trajectory of dust clouds in North Africa.
            To do this, it was necessary to select data relating to reflection, mineral composition and wind direction. Only with the integration of these 3 pillars can we create a system capable of predicting and warning about the dangers of dust clouds (informing the population) and demand for intervention (alerting the competent organizations. Ex: UN).</p>
