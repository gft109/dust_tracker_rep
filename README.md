The Dust Tracker Project is a system designed to utilize reflection and mineral composition data from the EMIT mission in the northern region of Africa. Its primary goal is to identify the existence and composition of dust clouds in the area, particularly when they pose a threat to the indigenous tribes living there.

The Dust Tracker Project processes and analyzes data collected from the EMIT mission, through Python-based data filtering and treatment techniques, to identify dust clouds in the northern African region. It uses advanced algorithms and data processing techniques to detect the presence of dust clouds and assess their composition. The system presents information on the dangers of dust clouds on its website and provides it through an interactive map. This map displays the locations of villages, the occurrence of events within the areas of interest (immediate Ã¡rea around the villages), and the composition of these clouds. In future versions, the system will include the functionality of direct notifications, alerting relevant organizations such as the United Nations (UN) about the events.

In the development of the Dust Tracker Project, Python played a pivotal role in data (collected by EMIT) processing, filtering, and analysis. Additionally, the project utilized the Flask web framework, employed for both frontend and backend development, to create our website. 

Our project aims to provide a range of essential benefits to the community and relevant organizations. Firstly, we prioritize raising community awareness by delivering timely information about the risks associated with dust clouds, empowering residents to take proactive measures to protect their health and resources. Secondly, we serve as an early warning system, detecting dust cloud events in their early stages to minimize their impact on vital resources and respiratory health. Thirdly, we actively engage with relevant organizations, sharing critical information about the presence of dust cloud events to enable swift responses and necessary interventions for the benefit of indigenous tribes. Finally, our geospatial monitoring capabilities track the activity of dust cloud events within a 50km radius of identified villages, providing valuable localized insights for targeted responses and resource allocation. Together, these advantages contribute to our overarching goal of enhancing the well-being and resilience of northern African indigenous tribes in the face of dust cloud events.
